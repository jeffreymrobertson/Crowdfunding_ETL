# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Purpose
The purpose for this project is to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

After you transforming the data, we created four CSV files.
Based on the CSV file data we created an ERD and a table schema. 
Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
